# 6 Kyu - Dashatize it

Given a variable n,

If n is an integer, Return a string with dash'-'marks before and after each odd integer, but do not begin or end the string with a dash mark. If n is negative, then the negative sign should be removed.

If n is not an integer, return an empty value.

Ex:

dashatize(274) -> '2-7-4'
dashatize(6815) -> '68-1-5'

### Notes

My solution feels very dirty. Could be much cleaner with regex.
